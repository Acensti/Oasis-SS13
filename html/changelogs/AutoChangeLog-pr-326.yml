changes:
  - rscadd: Emags allow traitors to anonymously purchase any shuttle they want without
      ID! Screwdrivers can be used on circuit boards as well, but adequate access
      is still required in that case.
  - tweak: The name of the authorizer, not the buyer, is printed on purchase of a
      shuttle.
  - tweak: Unsafe shuttles are now unavailable for purchase without emags/hacking.
